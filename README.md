# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide Pewlett Hackard with the number of employees that are retiring in a variety of roles at the company so that management can prepare for the large number of job openings that result. This analysis also provides the management team with the employees that are eligible to participate in a mentorship program based on the employees' date of birth. With this information in hand, Pewlett Hackard will be better prepared to implement a plan to effectively replace their retiring employees.
## Results
### Unique Titles
We removed duplicate occurrences of employee numbers that may have been created due to promotions and found that there 72,458 employees left at the company that are eligible to retire.
### Retirement By Title
After the query that gave us the number of current Pewlett Hackard employees that are eligible for retirement, we grouped the results by their titles to determine which roles would be most affected. 70% of the employees set to retire are in senior positions.

### Mentorship Eligibility
We found that there are 1,549 current employees that are eligible for the mentorship program based on birth date. These employees will be able to assist in preparing current employees that will be promoted as well as new employees.
### Mentorship Breakdown
While 70% of the employees set to retire are in senior positions, the breakdown of the employees eligible for the mentorship program is more balanced.

This more even distribution should better prepare the workers filling in throughout all the roles. However, there are no managers eligible based on the current criteria.
## Summary
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
There are 72,458 employees that are set to retire with many of them being in senior positions. While it is safe to assume that they all will not retire simultaneously, those roles will need to be filled eventually so the company should begin the process of filling in the openings to come.
### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
As previously mentioned in the "Mentorship Breakdown" section, there is an even distribution of roles between the employees that are eligible to participate in the mentorship program. However, there are no managers eligible based on the current criteria. No manager mentors is problematic as two of the five managers are set to retire. Regardless of that, the company should aim to hire significantly more managers to assist their employees and to distribute the responsibilities shouldered by the current management staff.
